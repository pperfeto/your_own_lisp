# Pointers

A pointer is a variation on a normal type where the type name is suffixed with
an asterisk. For example we could declare a *pointer to an integer* by writing
`int*`. We already saw a pointer type `char** argv`. This is a *pointer to
pointers to characters*, and is used as input to `main function`.
Pointers are used for a whole number of different things such as strings or
lists.
