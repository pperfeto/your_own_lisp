# Variables

Functions consist of manipulating *variables*. These are items of data which we give a name to.
Every variable in C has an explicit *type*. These types are declared by
ourselves or built into the language.

To create a new `int` called `count` we could write the following...
`int count;` or to declare it and set the value... `int count = 10;`

Heare are some descriptions and examples of some of the built in types:
- *void* Empty Type
- *char* Single Character/Byte - `char last_initial = 'H';`
- *int* Integer - `int age = 23;`
- *long* Integer tha can hold larger values
- *float* Decimal Number
- *double* Decimal Number with more precision
